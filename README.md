 CNN Image Classification using CIFAR-10

 Project Overview

This project is my Final Project for the Data Science Course, where I implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The goal was to understand how deep learning models learn visual features and classify images into multiple categories.

 About the Dataset (CIFAR-10)

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 color images (32×32 pixels) divided into 10 classes:

Airplane

Automobile

Bird

Cat

Deer

Dog

Frog

Horse

Ship

Truck


Some images are low-resolution and visually challenging, making the classification task difficult even for humans.

 Model Used

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Implemented using Python and Deep Learning libraries

Includes:

Convolution layers

Pooling layers

Fully connected (Dense) layers

Softmax output layer




---

 Challenges Faced

The model was trained using CPU instead of GPU, which made training slow and time-consuming

Despite limited computational resources, the model achieved ~70% accuracy, which is considered quite good for CIFAR-10, given the dataset complexity

 Results

Accuracy: ~70%

The model learned to automatically extract features such as edges, shapes, and object patterns

Demonstrates how neural networks are “smart” by learning from data and improving through errors
